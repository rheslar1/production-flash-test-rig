# Production Flash and Test Rig Runtime Design

## Module Structure

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app` | CLI, startup, argument parsing, and process status. |
| `domain` | Project-specific state, calculations, and decisions. |
| `adapters` | Hardware, OS, transport, persistence, model, or simulator integration. |
| `policy` | Safety and readiness gates. |
| `reporting` | Human-readable reports, telemetry, logs, or persistence statements. |
| `tests` | Scripted scenarios and edge-case checks. |

## C++17 Design

Recommended implementation style:

- Use plain structs for input, state, decisions, and issues.
- Use strong enums for scenario, state, severity, and command types.
- Use `std::optional` for recoverable missing values.
- Use `std::variant` only when the domain has a real closed set of alternatives.
- Prefer explicit dependencies passed to constructors.
- Keep ownership simple with values, references, and `std::unique_ptr` for polymorphic strategies.

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Strategy | Swap processors, validators, model engines, update policies, or control algorithms. |
| Adapter | Hide target-specific APIs behind stable project interfaces. |
| Facade | Provide a small runtime object that executes one complete scenario or cycle. |
| Composite | Combine multiple validation rules into one policy gate. |
| Repository/Sink | Isolate persistence, telemetry, or evidence output. |

## Nominal Sequence

1. Build a runtime profile for `production-flash-test-rig`.
2. Construct adapters and policies through dependency injection.
3. Collect scripted or target-backed input.
4. Convert input into domain state.
5. Evaluate policy gates.
6. Emit accepted output or rejected diagnostic evidence.
7. Return deterministic status for CI and automation.

## Project-Specific Focus

Repeatable board flashing, update-cycle validation, and long-run soak checks for deployment confidence.

The runtime must make this focus measurable through logs, reports, tests, diagrams, or hardware captures. The proof point for review is: Clear pass/fail evidence for firmware updates, board bring-up, and field acceptance.
